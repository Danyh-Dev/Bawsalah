# Bawsalah

This repository contains the **Bawsalah project**, developed as part of the **Software Engineering course**.  
The project demonstrates how to develop a full web application from **problem definition to implementation**.

## Project Overview
"Bawsalah" is a user-friendly travel guide website for the **Gulf region**, designed to provide curated, locally relevant content about cities like Dubai, Doha, and Riyadh.  
It helps travelers find accurate information about attractions, local customs, currency, and the best visiting times.

## Key Notes

- Names of team members and contributors have been **removed to protect their privacy**.  

## Features
- Curated travel content for Gulf cities  
- Easy-to-navigate interface  
- Search and filter options for planning trips  

## Folder Structure
